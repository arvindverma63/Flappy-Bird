```markdown
# Flappy Bird in Java 🎮🐦

A recreation of the classic **Flappy Bird** game built using **Java Swing** and **AWT**. This project is a simple yet fun way to dive into game development with Java's GUI libraries.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Dynamic Gameplay:** Smooth bird movement and procedurally generated pipes.
- **Collision Detection:** Accurate game mechanics for an immersive experience.
- **Keyboard Controls:** Use the `Space` key to flap your wings.
- **Game Over Screen:** Restart the game after colliding with obstacles.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Java**: Core programming language.
- **Swing**: For creating the GUI elements.
- **AWT**: For rendering graphics and handling game loops.
